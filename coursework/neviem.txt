The University Celiac Society is dedicated to fostering a supportive community for students with celiac disease and gluten intolerance. We aim to raise awareness about celiac disease, promote gluten-free living, and advocate for the needs of our members within the university community.
We are a group of students who understand the challenges of living with celiac disease and gluten intolerance. Our society provides a platform for sharing experiences, advice, and resources, and for advocating for greater understanding and accommodations within the university.
Whether you have celiac disease, are gluten intolerant, or simply interested in learning more, we welcome all members of the university community to join us. Participate in our events, volunteer, or become a member today!</p>
